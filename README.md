## Airport Data Structure

Each airport object contains the following fields:

```javascript
{
  iata: "SIN",                    // 3-letter IATA code
  icao: "WSSS",                   // 4-letter ICAO code
  time: "Asia/Singapore",         // Timezone identifier
  country_code: "SG",             // 2-letter country code
  continent: "AS",                // 2-letter continent code (AS, EU, NA, SA, AF, OC, AN)
  airport: "Singapore Changi Airport",  // Airport name
  latitude: "1.35019",            // Latitude coordinate
  longitude: "103.994003",        // Longitude coordinate
  elevation: "22",                // Elevation in feet
  type: "large_airport",          // Airport type
  scheduled_service: true,        // Has scheduled commercial service
  wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport",
  website: "https://www.changiairport.com",
  runway_length: "13200",         // Longest runway in feet
  flightradar24_url: "https://www.flightradar24.com/airport/SIN",
  radarbox_url: "https://www.radarbox.com/airport/WSSS",
  flightaware_url: "https://www.flightaware.com/live/airport/WSSS"
}
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const {
  getAirportByIata,
  getAirportByIcao,
  searchByName,
  findNearbyAirports
} = require('airport-data-js');

// Get airport by IATA code
const [airport] = await getAirportByIata('SIN');
console.log(airport.airport); // "Singapore Changi Airport"

// Get airport by ICAO code
const [airport] = await getAirportByIcao('WSSS');
console.log(airport.country_code); // "SG"

// Search airports by name
const airports = await searchByName('Singapore');
console.log(airports.length); // Multiple airports matching "Singapore"

// Find nearby airports (within 50km of coordinates)
const nearby = await findNearbyAirports(1.35019, 103.994003, 50);
console.log(nearby); // Airports near Singapore Changi
```

### Find airports near a city
```javascript
// Find airports within 100km of Paris
const parisAirports = await findNearbyAirports(48.8566, 2.3522, 100);
console.log(`Found ${parisAirports.length} airports near Paris`);
```

### Get flight distance

// Calculate distance between Singapore and London
const distance = await calculateDistance('SIN', 'LHR');
console.log(`Distance: ${Math.round(distance)} km`);
```

### Build an airport search interface
```javascript
// Get autocomplete suggestions
const suggestions = await getAutocompleteSuggestions('New York');
suggestions.forEach(airport => {
  console.log(`${airport.iata} - ${airport.airport}`);
});
```

### Filter airports by multiple criteria
```javascript
// Find large airports in Asia with scheduled service
const asianHubs = await findAirports({
  continent: 'AS',
  type: 'large_airport',
  has_scheduled_service: true
});
```
